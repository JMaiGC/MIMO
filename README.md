We present MIMO, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) from very simple user inputs. MIMO is a pretrained, generalizable model to simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework.
